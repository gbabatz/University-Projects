# Description

Tools used:
  - MATLAB and the corresponding MATLAB toolbox according to each case.

### Project 1 - Genetic Algorithms
  - An implementation of the Genetic Algorithm model, for the knapsack problem:
  *Maximization of the value of objects inside a bag with limited size.*

### Project 2 - Neural Networks
  - Function approximation by training a neural network with 2 hidden layers.

### Project 3 - Fuzzy Logic
  - System that controls the emergency braking of a car based on the car speed and object distance.
