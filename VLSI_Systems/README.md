Tools used:
  - SystemVerilog
  - Quartus
  - Modelsim
  - Online VGA simulator

### Semester Project.
  Implementation of Score 4 (or Connect 4) game in hardware. As *bonus* features, it supports:
  - custom user sprites.
  - automated opponent mode.

  The code contains both the basic and the full version.

The game was intended to run on a FPGA, with inputs from a keyboard and outputs to a VGA Screen, but due to Covid-19 the real hardware wasn't used. 
Instead the input designed to be 3 1-bit signals and the output was simulated with an online VGA simulator.
Luckily, the students had the chance to experiment hands on with FPGA and VGA, at least once on this class, and the design can easily be adjusted to fit on the setup mentioned.
