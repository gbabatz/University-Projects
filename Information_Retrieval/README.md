### Project 1:
  Using Lemur Toolkit (Indri):
  1. Created a shared index for some documents collections (documents not included).
  2. Generated the final queries according to information needs (information needs not included other than a sample). 
  3. Evaluated the system using relevance judgments (relevance judgements not included).
